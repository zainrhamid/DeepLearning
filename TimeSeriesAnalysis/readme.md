# Time Series Forecasts with Convolution Over LSTM

I'm excited to share my latest GitHub project focusing on time series forecasting using the power of TensorFlow and an innovative approach involving Convolutional over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. In this project, I delve into the intriguing realm of predicting daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne from 1981 to 1990, utilizing a combination of recurrent and convolutional neural network architectures.

## Overview

The heart of this project lies in the "Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne" dataset, which contains a treasure trove of historical data capturing the daily minimum temperatures spanning a decade. Armed with TensorFlow's cutting-edge capabilities, I aim to harness the intrinsic patterns and correlations present within the data to accurately predict future temperature trends.

## Part 2: Preprocessing Data

Preprocessing data is an essential step in any machine learning project. In this part, the project aims to preprocess the lung cancer dataset to prepare it for training the deep neural network. Preprocessing tasks may include data normalization, resizing, and feature extraction.

## Part 3: Building the Deep Neural Network

The core of the project lies in building a deep neural network, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for lung cancer detection. This part involves designing the architecture of the CNN model, defining the layers, and implementing the necessary forward and backward propagation algorithms.

## Part 4: Evaluating Performance

The final part of the project focuses on evaluating the performance of the trained CNN model. This includes testing the model on a separate test set, calculating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and visualizing the results. The evaluation helps in understanding the effectiveness and accuracy of the lung cancer detection model.
